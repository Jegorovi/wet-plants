# Wet plants

Have you ever over watered or under watered your planties? Well no more!

Sara's [@kobawan](https://github.com/kobawan) and Roland's [@Rolandisimo](https://github.com/Rolandisimo) planties will never die again with the help of this amaaaaazing app! 🌿🌱🥑

### Setup
We connected 4 moisture sensors to arduino and send the results through usb serial communication. Node-js listens to these values and determines whether they need watering 🎉
